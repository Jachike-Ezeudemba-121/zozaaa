                <p><span class="zoza1">Zora</span> <span class="zoza2">Oluwatoyin</span> <span class="zoza1">Adegbasan</span> is a student of Roseville Secondary School (SS2), Enugu. She is aged 15, born on 27th November, 2008 and aims at impacting people's lives in the future. She schooled in Silverbrook International before continuing her education in Roseville. I was lucky to experience her academic brilliance in primary school when she took first place for six consecutive years. She is humble, smart, nice, pretty, considerate, and fun to talk with. Those who know her can testify to my claims. She is wonderful academically as she is at swimming. She dominated the event for years and i was fortunate to be a part of those moments. She continued her exceptional academic performance in secondary school and wishes to further her education abroad, whether it is Delft, UCL or MIT. She enjoys swimming, taking pictures, naps and reading. One in a million.</p>
